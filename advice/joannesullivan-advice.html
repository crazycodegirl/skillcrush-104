			<h4>Don't be afraid to fail</h4>
			<p>Because you will fail. It happens. You can't expect perfection the first time out of the gate. But remember, failure is a learning opportunity;
				it is NOT the end of the road, and it absolutely DOES NOT mean that you can't do this. Because &lpar;and I'm quoting my favorite interior
				designer, Christopher Lowel, here&rpar; YOU CAN DO IT!</p>

			<h4>Take a walk</h4>
			<p>This goes back to not being afraid to fail.</p>

			<p>The first big challenge I did as part of my web development blue print had me seriously questioning my ability to become a developer. I had
				written some code that just would not cooperate, and I could not figure out why it wouldn't work. So, I walked away from it. I grabbed my iPod,
				put on my favorite playlist, and went for a walk. It had just gotten dark, the lights were on in the courtyard of my apartment building, hardly
				anyone was outside, and it was beautifully warm out. I walked around the complex, mulling the project over in my head, trying to work out why
				it wasn't working, and that's when I hit upon the solution. I went back inside, tried again, and it worked.</p>

			<h4>You're not in this alone</h4>
			<p>You might feel like you're alone, but you're not. Developers are a helpful bunch. They blog--oh boy, do they blog! And you're in class with a
				whole bunch of other developers. Check out the Google Group--sometimes, there's someone else out there who is having the same problem you are,
				and they've already asked about it. Check out the comments on their thread and see if the suggestions help you. If not, ask the question again,
				with your specific examples and code. You're in class with an amazing group of people, students and instructors. Let them help.</p>

			<p>And if you have a solution to someone else's problem, share it. Remember, you're a developer, too.</p>
